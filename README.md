======================

Code from Kernighan and Ritchie's 'The C Programming Language' second edition.  This is to help me learn C.
----------------------

Code can be compiled with:

    gcc hello.c

where 'hello.c' is the name of the file containing code.  This should result in an executable names 'a.out.'

If you want to name your outfile try:

    gcc hello.c -o hello

# EOF
